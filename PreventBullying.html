          <h3>What is Verbal Bullying?</h3>
          <p>Imagine someone using words in a mean way, like calling someone names, teasing them, or saying hurtful things about them. That's what we call verbal bullying. It's when words are used to make someone feel bad about themselves, scared, or upset. It's important to remember that words are very powerful and can hurt just as much as physical actions sometimes.</p>

          <h3>What is Physical Bullying?</h3>
          <p>Physical bullying is when someone uses their body or actions to hurt someone else or make them feel unsafe. This can include hitting, kicking, pushing, or even just threatening to do those things. It can also mean taking or breaking someone’s things on purpose.</p>
          <p>-</p>
          <p>It’s like using actions instead of words to be mean. It’s important to know that everyone has the right to feel safe and secure, and no one should use their strength or power to make someone else feel scared or hurt.</p>

          <h3>What is CyborgBullying</h3>
          <p>Cyberbullying is when someone uses the internet, a phone, or other technology to bully someone else. This can mean sending mean texts, posting unkind messages or pictures online, or even spreading rumors about someone on social media.</p>
          <p>-</p>
          <p>Just like in a video game where you might encounter challenges or obstacles, cyberbullying is a real-world challenge that requires courage and teamwork to overcome. It's not fair or okay for someone to make another person feel bad using technology.</p>
